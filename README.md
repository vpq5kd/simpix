***SIMPIX SOLUTIONS AND WRITEUP***
Program is unchanged from the initial starter code and can be run and built the exact same way. That being said, you are able to change the initial temperature, melting iterations, and number of iterations per temp step in the code itself. I, however, would not recommned doing this as the current parameters appear to be working *quite* well. 

**Note:** Unlike my salesman solution, this solution is still written with linear temperature decreasing, static internal iterations, and a fixed start temperature. Though this algorithm could be changed, the current code outputs a desirable solution in an extremely low amount of time, so it is uneccessary to change it at this time.

**Disclaimer:** chatGPT was used in the development of this program in a similar manner to the traditional Google search or Stack Overflow query. That is, of course, for edits and assistance with syntax, coding convetions, c/cpp standard functions, etc. Except where otherwise noted, it was not used for the development of original thoughts or algorithmic code. All of my code can be explained thoroughly by me if necessary.

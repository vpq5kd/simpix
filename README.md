***SIMPIX SOLUTIONS AND WRITEUP***
Program is unchanged from the initial starter code and can be run and built the exact same way. That being said, you are able to change the initial temperature, melting iterations, and number of iterations per temp step in the code itself. I, however, would not recommned doing this as the current parameters appear to be working *quite* well.
